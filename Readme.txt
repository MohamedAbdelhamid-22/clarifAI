Key Observations

For speed & simplicity: Mini-Xception is the best for real-time detection.

For accuracy & robustness: ResNet-50 works well but needs GPU acceleration.

For emotional trends over time: CNN + LSTM is ideal.

For research-level deep analysis: I3D or TimeSformer outperform all others but are harder to implement.
