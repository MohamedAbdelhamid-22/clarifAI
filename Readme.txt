ðŸ”‘ Key Notes on YOLO

Why useful?
Unlike other models, YOLO can detect multiple faces quickly and assign bounding boxes/IDs.
Then you can pipe each cropped face into an emotion classifier (ResNet/Mini-Xception).

Strength: Handles multi-student classroom videos better than standalone CNN models.

Best combo: YOLO for detection + ResNet/Mini-Xception for classification = speed + accuracy.

Limitation: YOLO itself doesnâ€™t predict emotions, only detects/locates faces.
